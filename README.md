## Automatic Licence Plate Recognition System (ALPR) System
 
<h3><strong>Project Description</strong></h3>

Led the design and implementation of an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system applied in a facility parking management system, utilizing deep learning algorithms for accurate license plate identification. Employed TensorFlow for model training and optimization, leveraging supervised learning techniques with a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Utilized OpenCV for image preprocessing and feature extraction, enhancing model performance. Applied Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques and advanced image processing methodologies to extract license plate characters in real-time, ensuring precise and reliable identification. Additionally, implemented model evaluation and validation techniques to assess the performance of the ANPR system, including cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
