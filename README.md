## ANPR Project
 
# Project Description 

ANPR Parking Management System. Led the design and implementation of an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system, utilizing deep learning algorithms for accurate
license plate identification. Employed TensorFlow for model training and optimization, leveraging supervised learning
techniques with a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Utilized OpenCV for image preprocessing and feature extraction,
enhancing model performance. Applied Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques and advanced image processing methodologies to extract license plate characters in real-time, ensuring precise and reliable identification.
Additionally, implemented model evaluation and validation techniques to assess the performance of the ANPR system, including cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
